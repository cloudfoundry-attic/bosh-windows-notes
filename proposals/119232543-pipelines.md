# BOSH Windows and pipelines

In trying to validate the work being done on BOSH Windows we want all releases
on CF that have components that need to run on Windows to have their own
pipelines for testing functionality and integration.

Those components are, along with its teams:

  * `diego-release`: `rep/executor`; Diego, San Francisco, CA
  * `consul-release`: `consul_agent`; Infrastructure, Los Angeles, CA
  * `loggregator-release`: `metron_agent`; LAMB, Denver, CO
  * `garden-windows-release`: `garden_windows`; Greenhouse, New York, NY

Running `WATs` requires a full CloudFoundry, which means all of the above need
to exist. To be able to iterate quickly we can start working on the leaf
dependencies first.

  * `diego-release` depends on `consul-release` and `garden-windows-release` for basic testing.
  * `loggregator-release` has no dependencies for basic testing (?: validate
    with Denver that this is true).
  * `consul-release` has no dependencies for basic testing.
  * `garden-windows-release` has no dependencies for basic testing.

## Pipeline for `garden-windows-release`

* Pulls form a `garden-windows-release` repository that contains a BOSH release
  for `garden-windows`
* Creates a dev release
* Deploys that dev release to a *new* test environment
* Runs minimal garden windows integration tests
* PM has a manual job `shipit` that creates and releases a final release of
  `garden-windows-release` to github and bosh.io

## Pipeline for `consul-release`

*Needs discussion with the Infrastructure team about what is enough testing,
should be ran and owned by the Infrastructure team and should be part of the
mainline `consul-release`, containing a `consul_agent_windows` job that can be
consumed by other pipelines.*

## Pipeline for `loggregator-release`

*Needs discussion with the Loggregator team about what is enough testing,
should be ran and owned by the Loggregator team and should be part of the
mainline `loggregator-release`, containing a `metron_agent_windows` job that
can be consumed by other pipelines.*

## Pipeline for `diego-release`

  * Run unit tests for rep and executor on Windows using `concourse-windows`
  * Run (write?) [`inigo`](http://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/inigo)
    style tests to exercise Windows behavior with a local `garden-windows`
  * **`garden-windows-release` is needed for the following**
  * Deploy a set of Windows cells alongside the Linux cells on the main CI CF
    deployment
  * **`consul_agent_windows` is needed for the following**
  * Run (write?) a
    [`vizzini`](http://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/vizzini) style test
    suite to exercise larger integration with Diego (no CF)
  * **`metron_agent_windows` is needed for the following**
  * Run (write?) a CF level smoke test for a simple Windows app push
  * Run `WATs`
